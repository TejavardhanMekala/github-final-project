# github-final-project
This project hosts a simple Bash script that calculates simple interest based on the principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years. The calculator is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate basic coding and version control practices using GitHub. This initial project serves as a stepping stone for the micro-finance startup's transition from Subversion (SVN) to Git, aligning with their mission to empower low-income individuals by providing them with financial tools and educational resources.
- Input: p (principal amount), t (time period in years), r (annual rate of interest)
- Output: simple interest = p * t * r
