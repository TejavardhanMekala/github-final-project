# Contributing to the Simple Interest Calculator

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache Software License 2.0
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that covers the project. This includes new code, config files, or documentation.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/yourusername/github-final-project/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/github-final-project/issues/new); it's that easy!

**Note:** Replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username in the above links to correctly direct users.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great bug reports tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* You can use an editor like [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to automatically format your code.
* Check your code for any linting errors and fix them.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its Apache License 2.0.
